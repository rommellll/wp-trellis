The Wishlist refers to the features that allow the potential customers to add their desired products to a list and later they can decide whether they want to buy them or not. So that, after making their final decisions on whether they want to buy them or not they can add the products to the cart or remove them from the wishlist. These features should be available to all online stores because not all customers can make an instant decision while browsing products on an online store. Later when they make the decisions that they want to buy the product it will be difficult for them to find the product from numerous options. So as an online store owner you must make it easier for the customers. And, the flexible wishlist is the best solution for this kind of situation. ProductX offers two types of wishlists, pop-up and redirecting a wishlist page.
